# My Personal Web Profile - CMSC 207 Mini-Project

This is my personal website created for the CMSC 207 Mini-Project. It's a single page that shares a bit about me, my interests, and how to contact me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About This Project

This website is inspired by Clyde Hatter's book "Create with Code: Build Your Own Website." I made it work well on both phones and computers, using good HTML structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to make it interactive.

Even though I've worked with web technologies for years, this project was a nice opportunity to go back to the basics and practice writing clean, simple code.

## What's Included

- **Adjusts to Screen Size**: Works well on phones and computers
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper HTML tags to organize content
- **Simple Navigation**: Click on menu items to smoothly scroll to different sections
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - "Fun Fact" button that shows and hides extra information
  - Images and buttons change appearance when you hover over them
- **Custom Colors**: Uses a custom color scheme that's easy to update

- ✅ **CSS Styling**: Separate style file for the design
- ✅ **JavaScript Features**: Button that shows a fun fact when clicked
- ✅ **Works on All Devices**: Layout adjusts for phones and computers
- ✅ **Working Menu**: Menu links that smoothly scroll to each section
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Elements change style when you hover over them

## Short Reflection

### Challenges I Faced:

Picking colors for the color scheme was difficult than I expected. I used websites like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and similar color palette generators to help me find colors that look good together.

Getting the page to scroll smoothly when clicking menu items took quite a bit of testing. I had to try different approaches until I found one that worked well on different web browsers.

Making the website look good on both phones and computers was challenging. I had to adjust the layout multiple times to make sure everything looked nice whether you're viewing on a small screen or a large one.

I also ran into some browser differences - for example, I found that some CSS properties (like `aspect-ratio: 1/1` for the profile picture) don't work the same way in Firefox as they do in other browsers.

### What I Learned:

Even though I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for years (I completed the Full Stack Certification on freeCodeCamp back in May 2020), this project was a great refresher on the basics.

For the past 3 years, I've been using Tailwind CSS at work, so I had to review vanilla CSS to accomplish this task. It was good to get back to CSS fundamentals after relying on a utility-first framework for so long.

I enjoyed practicing with layout tools like flexbox again (I used a fun game called [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) to brush up). Using CSS variables for colors made updating the theme much easier than changing each color individually.

This project reminded me how important it is to write clean, organized code. I also found helpful resources like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) when I needed to look up specific details or troubleshoot browser compatibility issues.
