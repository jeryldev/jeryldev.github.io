            <p>
              Hi there! I'm Jeryl, a software engineer who loves building useful things with code.
              My professional journey spans a diverse range of roles across different industries -
              from private fund accounting and alternative investments, to technical support for
              portfolio management systems and cloud-based accounting software, and now to software
              engineering. I've helped build payment systems for a cryptocurrency exchange and
              currently contribute to legal tech applications. This breadth of experience gives me a
              unique perspective when approaching software problems.
            </p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              I started out in a completely different world - finance! After graduating with an
              Accountancy degree in 2012, I was fortunate to work with financial systems that
              sparked my curiosity about how technology actually works. This led me down a path
              through technical support roles where I got to learn so much about software from the
              inside out. Each role taught me something valuable that I now apply to software
              engineering.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
            <p>
              What drew me to software engineering? It's the amazing blend of creativity and
              problem-solving that gets me excited every day! There's something truly magical about
              turning an idea into working code that helps solve real problems. I'm constantly
              amazed by how much there is to learn in this field - every project brings new
              challenges and opportunities to grow. The most rewarding part is seeing something I've
              helped create actually making someone's day a little easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm grateful to be able to contribute to full-stack applications using tools like
              Elixir/Phoenix and JavaScript, work on neat features using AI technologies, and build
              solutions that help people in their daily work. It's a privilege to be part of
              creating technology that makes a difference!
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm also taking classes toward a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science, which is
              helping me understand the "why" behind the "how" of programming - it's fascinating to
              connect theory with practical application!
            </p>

            <p>
              I'd love to connect and learn from others in the field! Feel free to check out my

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy exploring distributed systems using Elixir and OTP. I've recently started
              reading "Ash Framework: Create Declarative Elixir Web Apps" by Rebecca Le and Zach
              Daniel. Last year, I finished "Designing Elixir Systems with OTP: Write Highly
              Scalable, Self-Healing Software with Layers" which helped deepen my understanding of
              building robust systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
              I love diving into both technical books and novels. I'm constantly adding new
              programming books to my collection to improve my skills. When it comes to fiction,
              John Grisham's legal thrillers like "Rogue Lawyer" and "The Rainmaker" are among my
              favorites.

            <h3>Chess & Basketball</h3>
            <p>
              Chess fascinates me with its depth and strategy. I enjoy rewatching classic games from
              legends like Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Tal, while also following current tournament
              matches of players like Grandmaster Wesley So, former World Champion Magnus Carlsen,
              and International Master/Woman Grandmaster Lu Miaoyi. In basketball, I'm a Minnesota
              Timberwolves fan, particularly admiring their 2004 lineup with Kevin Garnett, Latrell
              Sprewell, and Sam Cassell.
